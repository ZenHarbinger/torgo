[Snaps](http://snapcraft.io/) are a new way to package and deliver Linux applications to users.  Built by Ubuntu and now available on most recent distros, snap makes packaging easier.

I have been working on getting a snap for [Torgo](http://tros.org/torgo/) for a while and today I finally found the [fix for a font configuration error](https://askubuntu.com/questions/791853/snap-package-for-java-swing-and-awt-application-crashes-when-it-is-executed) I'd been getting for a while.

This also allowed me to then use the version of openjdk-8 that is in the repos instead of supplying a copy manually.  While supplying the copy manually is a bonus for how snaps are handled for dependencies, I did not want to have to have an x86 and an amd64 version of files because of two different versions of a jdk.  Now I can use one yaml file.  Next is to figure out how to cross-compile snaps.

## Install Torgo

Without further ado:

```sh
sudo snap install torgo
```

## Configurations

Here is my wrapper file.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# Not good, needed for fontconfig
export XDG_DATA_HOME=$SNAP/usr/share
# Font Config
export FONTCONFIG_PATH=$SNAP/etc/fonts/config.d
export FONTCONFIG_FILE=$SNAP/etc/fonts/fonts.conf
export HOME=$SNAP_USER_DATA

$SNAP/usr/lib/jvm/default-java/bin/java -Duser.home=$HOME -jar $SNAP/jar/torgo-1.0.6.jar
```

Here is my yaml file.  I'm probably importing too many stage-packages, but what is important is that it is working!

```yml
name: torgo
version: 1.0.6
